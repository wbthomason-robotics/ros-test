\subsection{Publishing and Subscribing}
\label{p:topics}

The goal of this problem is to have you learn how to move a turtle using Twist messages and
calculate the distance between turtle and a point.

The work for this problem should be done in file \texttt{pubsub.py}.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item In \texttt{\_\_init\_\_}:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
      \item First, have your turtle subscribe to \texttt{turtle1/pose} with the callback function
        \texttt{self.update\_pose}. %(\textit{X points})
      \item Have your turtle publish to \texttt{turtle1/cmd\_vel}. %(\textit{X points})
      \item Specify a publishing rate of $10$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item In \texttt{move}:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
      \item Create a Twist message with values that change both the angular and linear velocities
        such that the turtle moves both angularly and linearly.
      \item Publish the Twist message to the velocity publisher.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item In \texttt{update\_pose}:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
      \item Set the instance variable \texttt{self.pose} to the information provided by the subscriber.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item In \texttt{calculate\_distance}:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
      \item Using \texttt{numpy}, set \texttt{vector} to be the difference between the coordinates
        of the turtle's current pose and the point $(x,y)$. (Hint: Use a \texttt{numpy} array for
        your vector)
      \item Using \texttt{numpy} and \texttt{vector}, set \texttt{distance} to the distance between the
        turtle and the point $(x,y)$.
      \item Set the ROS parameter to \texttt{distance}. (Note: the value of distance must be cast
        to a float).
    \end{enumerate}
  \item In \texttt{pubsub.launch}:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
      \item Review the format of this file and understand what it does (see ROS launch file
        documentation for more information).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
